    <p><b>INSTRUCTION:
    </b></p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Start by marinating the chicken (or lamb): In a bowl, combine the yogurt, vegetable oil, chopped onion, minced garlic, ginger paste, ground coriander, ground cumin, turmeric powder, salt, and pepper.

            </li>
            <li>
                In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add 1 teaspoon of salt and the drained rice. Cook the rice until it's 70-80% cooked (still slightly firm). Drain the rice and set it aside.

                    <li>Add the partially cooked rice to the pot with the meat. Gently mix to combine. </li>
                    <li>
                        Reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and let the rice and meat cook together for about 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked and the meat is tender.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            While the pulao is cooking, in a separate small pan, heat 1/4 cup of vegetable oil. Add the slivered almonds and raisins (if using) and fry until they turn golden brown. Remove from heat.
